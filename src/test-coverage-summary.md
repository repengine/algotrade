# AlgoStack Test Coverage Summary Report

## Overall Coverage: 6%

This critically low coverage indicates significant testing gaps across the codebase, presenting substantial risk for a trading system handling real money.

## Coverage Breakdown by Category

### 🟢 Well-Tested Modules (>70% coverage)
- **utils/logging.py**: 94% - Excellent coverage for logging utilities
- **core/executor.py**: 71% - Good coverage for core execution logic

### 🟡 Moderately Tested Modules (30-70% coverage)
- **strategies/base.py**: 41% - Base strategy class has partial coverage
- **core/engine/order_manager.py**: 42% - Order management partially tested

### 🔴 Poorly Tested Critical Modules (<30% coverage)
These modules are critical for trading operations but have dangerously low test coverage:

- **core/metrics.py**: 24% - Risk metrics calculation inadequately tested
- **core/engine/trading_engine.py**: 24% - Core trading engine needs extensive testing
- **core/backtest_metrics.py**: 20% - Backtesting metrics validation insufficient
- **core/engine/enhanced_order_manager.py**: 19% - Enhanced order features largely untested
- **core/engine/execution_handler.py**: 18% - Order execution logic critically undertested

### ⚠️ Zero Coverage Modules (0%)
These critical modules have NO test coverage, representing extreme risk:

**Core Trading Components:**
- **core/live_engine.py** - Live trading engine completely untested
- **core/portfolio.py** - Portfolio management has no tests
- **core/risk.py** - Risk management system entirely untested

**Strategy Implementations:**
- All concrete strategy implementations lack tests
- Only the base strategy class has any coverage (41%)

**Other Critical Components:**
- Data handlers
- API integrations
- Market adapters
- Order state synchronization

## Risk Assessment

### 🚨 CRITICAL RISKS:
1. **Capital at Risk**: Core risk management (0%) and portfolio management (0%) are completely untested
2. **Execution Risk**: Order execution handler at only 18% coverage
3. **Live Trading Risk**: Live engine has 0% coverage - deploying to production would be extremely dangerous
4. **Strategy Risk**: No concrete strategies are tested, making backtesting results unreliable

### Priority Areas for Immediate Testing:
1. **core/risk.py** - Must have 100% coverage before any live trading
2. **core/live_engine.py** - Critical path for all live operations
3. **core/portfolio.py** - Position and capital management
4. **core/engine/execution_handler.py** - Order execution accuracy
5. Strategy implementations - At least one full strategy with >90% coverage

## Recommendations

1. **HALT any live trading** until critical modules reach minimum 80% coverage
2. **Implement comprehensive test suite** following the Four Pillars:
   - Capital Preservation: Test all risk limits and validations
   - Profit Generation: Test strategy logic and execution
   - Operational Stability: Test error handling and recovery
   - Verifiable Correctness: Test metrics and reporting

3. **Set minimum coverage targets**:
   - Critical modules (risk, portfolio, live engine): 90%+
   - Core modules (trading engine, execution): 80%+
   - Strategy implementations: 85%+
   - Utilities and helpers: 70%+

4. **Establish CI/CD gates**: Reject any PR that reduces coverage or doesn't meet module minimums

## Conclusion

With only 6% overall coverage and 0% coverage on critical financial components, this codebase is not ready for production use. The lack of tests on risk management, portfolio tracking, and live trading components presents an unacceptable risk of capital loss.

**Immediate action required**: Focus all development effort on achieving comprehensive test coverage for critical modules before any further feature development.
