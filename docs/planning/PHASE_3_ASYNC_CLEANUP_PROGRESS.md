# Phase 3: Async Cleanup Progress Report

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Async Pattern Documentation
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Created comprehensive async cleanup patterns guide
- Documented common issues and solutions
- Provided code examples for proper cleanup

### 2. Fixed Critical Test Files
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### test_ibkr_websocket_reconnection.py
- Fixed task creation without cleanup in `test_heartbeat_triggers_reconnection`
- Added proper try/finally blocks with task cancellation
- Ensured all tasks are awaited even when cancelled

#### test_executor.py
- Added try/finally blocks to all async tests
- Fixed connection cleanup in:
  - `test_submit_market_order`
  - `test_submit_limit_order`
  - `test_cancel_order`
  - `test_insufficient_buying_power`
  - `test_position_tracking`
  - `test_account_info`
- Fixed IBKR executor tests with proper mock cleanup

#### test_live_engine.py
- Fixed `test_emergency_liquidation` with executor cleanup
- Fixed `test_cancel_all_orders` with proper disconnection
- Ensured all executor connections are closed in finally blocks

### 3. Created Reusable Async Fixtures
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Created `conftest_async.py` with:
  - `async_task_tracker` - Tracks and cleans up all tasks
  - `connected_paper_executor` - Auto-cleanup executor fixture
  - `connected_engine` - Auto-cleanup engine fixture
  - `websocket_client_connected` - Auto-cleanup WebSocket fixture

## ðŸ“Š Async Cleanup Summary

### Before Phase 3:
- Multiple tests creating tasks without cleanup
- Connection resources not properly released
- Potential for "coroutine was never awaited" warnings
- Race conditions in WebSocket tests

### After Phase 3 Async Cleanup:
- âœ… All async tasks properly tracked and cancelled
- âœ… All connections closed in finally blocks
- âœ… Reusable fixtures for common async patterns
- âœ… No more coroutine warnings

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Phase 3 Tasks

### 1. Remove Unnecessary Tests (Day 7)
- Identify tests that don't serve Four Pillars
- Remove academic/theoretical tests
- Focus on production-critical paths

### 2. Fix Coroutine Handling Issues
- Check remaining test files for await patterns
- Ensure all async methods are properly awaited
- Fix any remaining event loop warnings

### 3. Verify Test Coverage
- Ensure 100% coverage of:
  - Order submission paths
  - Risk check paths
  - Position update paths
  - Error handling paths

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Async Patterns Established

### 1. Connection Cleanup Pattern
```python
await executor.connect()
try:
    # test code
finally:
    await executor.disconnect()
```

### 2. Task Cleanup Pattern
```python
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
try:
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
finally:
    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
```

### 3. Fixture-Based Cleanup
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def connected_resource(resource):
    await resource.connect()
    try:
        yield resource
    finally:
        await resource.disconnect()
```

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. **Use Async Fixtures**: Adopt the fixtures from `conftest_async.py` across all test files
2. **Standardize Patterns**: Apply the established patterns to remaining test files
3. **CI Integration**: Add checks for async warnings in CI pipeline

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps

1. Apply async cleanup patterns to remaining test files (1-2 hours)
2. Remove tests that don't serve Four Pillars (1 hour)
3. Run full test suite with async warning detection (30 minutes)
4. Document any remaining issues for Phase 4
