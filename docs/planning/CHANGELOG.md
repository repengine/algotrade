      # Only register objects that can have weak references
      try:
          weakref.ref(obj)
          self._managed_objects[name] = obj
          logger.debug(f"Registered object for memory management: {name}")
      except TypeError:

#### 1. Fixed conftest.py Asyncio Issues ✅
- Resolved pytest-asyncio event loop scope problems
- Added proper async fixture handling
- Fixed event loop cleanup

#### 2. Portfolio Tests Comprehensive Fix ✅
Fixed all 33 failing tests in test_portfolio_comprehensive.py:
- Fixed leverage validation (TypeError → ValueError)
- Corrected future position P&L calculations
- Fixed timestamp handling for metrics
- Updated event emission patterns

#### 3. Risk Tests Comprehensive Fix ✅
Fixed all 21 failing tests in test_risk_comprehensive.py:
- Added proper risk-free rate defaults
- Fixed position limit calculations
- Corrected VaR confidence level validation
- Fixed numpy array handling

#### 4. Risk Coverage Tests Fix ✅
Fixed all 21 failing tests in test_risk_coverage.py:
- Aligned with RiskMetrics dataclass
- Fixed statistical calculations
- Added proper error handling

### Technical Improvements

1. **Asyncio Infrastructure**: Now properly handles async tests
2. **Error Type Consistency**: ValueError for validation across codebase
3. **Test Patterns**: Established patterns for mocking and fixtures
4. **Documentation**: Clear patterns for fixing similar issues

### Metrics

| Metric | Start | End | Change |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| Tests Passing | 445 | 520 | +75 ✅ |
| Pass Rate | 55.0% | 64.3% | +9.3% ✅ |
| Files with Errors | 121 | 95 | -26 ✅ |

### Next Priorities

1. **Executor Tests** (~40 tests to fix)
2. **Integration Tests** (~30 tests to fix)
3. **Strategy Tests** (~25 tests to fix)
4. **E2E Tests** (~20 tests to fix)
