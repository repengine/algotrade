# AlgoTrade Error Resolution Action Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ PRIME DIRECTIVE ALIGNMENT
Every fix in this plan serves the Four Pillars and moves us toward a **production-ready trading system that can safely manage real money**.

## ðŸ“Š Error Analysis Summary

### Total Errors: ~430 failures across 1,386 tests
- **Critical Safety Issues**: 45% (missing risk checks, order validation)
- **API/Integration Issues**: 25% (missing endpoints, incorrect routing)
- **Test Pattern Issues**: 20% (outdated mocks, incorrect assertions)
- **Minor Issues**: 10% (naming, imports)

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix First)

### 1. **Missing Live Trading Safety Methods** [PILLAR 1: CAPITAL PRESERVATION]
**Impact**: Direct risk to capital if deployed
**Files Affected**: 
- `src/core/live_engine.py`
- `src/core/engine/order_manager.py`
- `src/core/portfolio.py`

**Missing Methods**:
- `LiveTradingEngine.process_market_data()` - Required for real-time data processing
- `LiveTradingEngine.collect_signals()` - Required for strategy signal aggregation
- `LiveTradingEngine._update_portfolio()` - Required for position tracking
- `OrderManager.add_order()` - Critical for order tracking
- `DataHandler.validate_data()` - Critical for data integrity

**Action**: Implement these methods with proper validation and error handling

### 2. **Risk Management Integration Failures** [PILLAR 1: CAPITAL PRESERVATION]
**Impact**: Orders could bypass risk checks
**Files Affected**:
- `src/core/risk.py`
- `tests/integration/test_trading_flow.py`

**Issues**:
- `order.side.value` assumes Enum but receives string
- Missing correlation calculations in risk checks
- No position concentration validation

**Action**: Fix type handling and implement missing risk validations

### 3. **Position Constructor Missing Fields** [PILLAR 4: VERIFIABLE CORRECTNESS]
**Impact**: Cannot track positions accurately
**Issue**: `Position()` missing required `strategy_id` parameter

**Action**: Update Position model to include strategy_id for proper attribution

## ðŸ“¡ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. **API Endpoint Routing (404 Errors)** [PILLAR 3: OPERATIONAL STABILITY]
**Impact**: Cannot monitor or control system via API
**Files Affected**: `src/api/app.py`

**Missing Routes**:
- `/health` - System health check
- `/status` - Trading system status
- `/positions` - Current positions
- `/orders` - Order management
- `/performance` - Performance metrics

**Action**: Implement all missing API endpoints with proper error handling

### 5. **Data Source Integration** [PILLAR 3: OPERATIONAL STABILITY]
**Impact**: System cannot fetch market data reliably
**Issues**:
- `YFinanceFetcher` missing `fetch()` method
- No failover mechanism for data sources

**Action**: Implement data fetcher interface with proper failover

## ðŸ”§ MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 6. **Test Pattern Mismatches** [PILLAR 4: VERIFIABLE CORRECTNESS]
**Impact**: Tests don't reflect production behavior
**Common Patterns**:
- Tests expect methods that don't exist (outdated)
- Mock objects don't match actual interfaces
- Assertions check for wrong response format

**Action**: Update tests to match robust implementation patterns

### 7. **Signal Validation Errors** [PILLAR 2: PROFIT GENERATION]
**Issue**: `Signal` model rejects negative strength for LONG signals
**Impact**: Valid short signals being rejected

**Action**: Fix Signal validation logic to handle all signal types correctly

### 8. **Async/Await Pattern Issues** [PILLAR 3: OPERATIONAL STABILITY]
**Issues**:
- Coroutines not being awaited properly
- Task cleanup issues in tests
- WebSocket reconnection race conditions

**Action**: Fix async patterns and ensure proper cleanup

## ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY ORDER

### Phase 1: Critical Safety Features (Days 1-3)
1. **Implement missing LiveTradingEngine methods**
   - `process_market_data()` with validation
   - `collect_signals()` with deduplication
   - `_update_portfolio()` with atomic updates

2. **Fix OrderManager**
   - Add `add_order()` method with validation
   - Implement order state tracking
   - Add duplicate order detection

3. **Fix Risk Management**
   - Handle both string and Enum order sides
   - Implement position concentration checks
   - Add correlation-based risk limits

### Phase 2: API and Integration (Days 4-5)
4. **Implement API endpoints**
   - Create all missing routes
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement rate limiting

5. **Fix data source integration**
   - Implement YFinanceFetcher.fetch()
   - Add data validation
   - Implement failover mechanism

### Phase 3: Test Alignment (Days 6-7)
6. **Update test patterns**
   - Fix mock interfaces
   - Update assertions to match implementation
   - Remove tests for unnecessary features

7. **Fix async patterns**
   - Proper task cleanup
   - Fix coroutine handling
   - WebSocket reconnection fixes

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA

Each fix must:
1. **Serve at least one of the Four Pillars**
2. **Include error handling for production scenarios**
3. **Have tests that reflect real trading conditions**
4. **Be documented with risk implications**

## ðŸš« WHAT NOT TO DO

- Don't fix tests by removing safety checks
- Don't implement features just to make tests pass
- Don't add complexity without safety benefits
- Don't ignore edge cases that could lose money

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking

- [ ] Phase 1: Critical Safety Features (0/3 complete)
- [ ] Phase 2: API and Integration (0/2 complete)  
- [ ] Phase 3: Test Alignment (0/2 complete)

## ðŸŽ¯ End Goal

A trading system where:
- Every order is validated and risk-checked
- All positions are tracked accurately
- API provides full system visibility
- Tests prove the system works with real money
- Failures are handled gracefully

**Remember**: We're building a system to trade real money. Every line of code matters.
