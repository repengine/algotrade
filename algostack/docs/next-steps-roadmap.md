# AlgoStack Development Roadmap - Next Steps

Based on the development plan and current progress, here are the next critical steps:

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 8: Execution Bridge)

### 1. **Broker Adapters & Order Management**
Create execution adapters for actual trading:
- **IBKR adapter** (`adapters/ibkr_exec.py`) - Interactive Brokers via ib_insync
- **Paper trading adapter** for testing
- **Order management system** with:
  - Order routing logic
  - Fill tracking and reconciliation
  - Connection monitoring and auto-reconnect
  - Order throttling to avoid rate limits

### 2. **Live Trading Engine**
Integrate everything into a live trading system:
- **Main event loop** that coordinates strategies → portfolio → execution
- **Real-time data feeds** 
- **Position reconciliation** between internal state and broker
- **Error handling** and recovery mechanisms

## Following Steps (Phases 9-10)

### 3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
- **FastAPI dashboard** (`api/app.py`) for real-time status
- **Performance metrics API** 
- **Discord/Email alerts** for:
  - Trade executions
  - Risk limit breaches
  - System errors
  - Daily P&L summary

### 4. **Production Hardening**
- **Integration tests** with paper trading
- **Data quality checks** and fallback providers
- **Deployment automation**:
  - Docker compose for services
  - SystemD service files
  - Automated backups of state
  - Log rotation and monitoring

### 5. **Operational Tools**
- **CLI commands** for:
  - Manual position overrides
  - Strategy enable/disable
  - Risk limit adjustments
  - Emergency liquidation
- **State persistence** (positions, P&L, settings)
- **Audit trail** of all decisions and trades

## Suggested Implementation Order

**Week 1: Core Execution**
```python
# 1. Create base executor interface
# 2. Implement paper trading executor  
# 3. Build order management system
# 4. Add IBKR executor
```

**Week 2: Live Trading Loop**
```python
# 1. Main trading engine that runs strategies
# 2. Integration with portfolio engine
# 3. Real-time data coordination
# 4. Error handling and recovery
```

**Week 3: Monitoring**
```python
# 1. FastAPI status dashboard
# 2. Performance tracking APIs
# 3. Alert system implementation
# 4. Basic web UI
```

**Week 4: Production Ready**
```python
# 1. Comprehensive testing suite
# 2. Deployment scripts
# 3. Documentation
# 4. Go-live checklist
```

## Critical Considerations

### Before Going Live:
1. **Paper trade for 30 days** minimum
2. **Implement dead-man switch** - auto-liquidate if system fails
3. **Set up redundant data feeds** 
4. **Create manual override tools**
5. **Document emergency procedures**

### Risk Management Checklist:
- [ ] All strategies tested with walk-forward analysis
- [ ] Risk limits verified in paper trading
- [ ] Broker API limits understood and respected
- [ ] Backup systems in place
- [ ] Monitoring alerts tested
- [ ] Capital allocation plan documented

## Implementation Priority

1. **Execution Bridge** (Phase 8) - Critical for live trading
2. **Monitoring & Alerts** (Phase 9) - Essential for operations
3. **Production Hardening** (Phase 10) - Required for reliability

The system should be paper traded extensively before any real capital is deployed.
