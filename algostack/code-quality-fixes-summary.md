# Code Quality Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing 'Any' Import
- **core/portfolio.py**: Already had `Any` import (line 6)
- **core/risk.py**: Already had `Any` import (line 6)

### 2. Division by Zero Error Handling
Fixed the following division operations to handle zero denominators:

#### strategies/base.py
- Fixed `profit_factor` calculation to properly handle zero losses
- Simplified the calculation logic by removing unnecessary loop

#### strategies/mean_reversion_equity.py
- Fixed `profit_factor` calculation to return infinity when total_losses is 0 and there are wins
- Returns 0.0 when both wins and losses are 0

#### core/portfolio.py
- Added protection for `current_drawdown` calculation when `peak_equity` is 0

#### core/engine/order_manager.py
- Added protection for average fill price calculation when `filled_quantity` is 0

#### core/risk.py
- Added `.fillna(0)` to drawdown calculation to handle potential NaN values from division

### 3. Missing Type Hints
Added return type hints to the following functions:

#### strategies/intraday_orb.py
- `reset_daily_counters(self) -> None`

#### strategies/overnight_drift.py
- `load_event_calendar(self, events: Dict[str, List[datetime]]) -> None`

#### core/risk.py
- `objective(weights: np.ndarray) -> float` (nested function in portfolio_optimization)

#### conftest.py
- Added return type hints to all fixture functions:
  - `sample_ohlcv_data() -> pd.DataFrame`
  - `portfolio_config() -> Dict[str, Any]`
  - `strategy_config() -> Dict[str, Any]`
  - `mock_market_data() -> Dict[str, pd.DataFrame]`
  - `mock_signals() -> List[Signal]`
  - `risk_config() -> Dict[str, Any]`
  - `pytest_configure(config) -> None`
  - `setup_test_environment() -> None`
  - `mock_yfinance(mocker) -> None`
  - `mock_broker_connection(mocker) -> Any`
- Added required imports: `List` type and `Signal` class

#### tests/test_risk_manager.py
- Added return type hints to all fixture functions
- Added required import: `Dict, Any` types

#### run_tests.py
- `run_tests() -> int`
- `setup_test_environment() -> None`

## Notes

Most functions in the codebase already had proper type hints. The fixes focused on:
1. Test fixtures that were missing return type annotations
2. A few strategy methods that were missing return type hints
3. Nested functions that needed type annotations

All division operations now have proper zero-division protection, either through:
- Explicit conditional checks (e.g., `if denominator > 0`)
- Ternary operators with fallback values
- Using `.fillna()` for pandas operations

The code now follows best practices for type safety and error handling.
